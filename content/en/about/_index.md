Welcome to the About section! Here you can learn about the ideas and principles that guide Rivaas development.

## What is Rivaas?

Rivaas is a web framework for Go. We built it to make creating web APIs easier and more enjoyable. The name comes from **ریواس (Rivās)**, a wild rhubarb plant that grows in the mountains of Iran.

Just like this tough mountain plant, Rivaas is:

- **Strong** — Built to handle production workloads
- **Light** — Fast and uses little memory
- **Flexible** — Works in many different environments
- **Independent** — Each piece works on its own

## Our Goals

We want Rivaas to be:

1. **Easy to use** — You should understand it quickly
2. **Hard to misuse** — Good defaults keep you safe
3. **Fun to work with** — Clear APIs and helpful errors
4. **Ready for production** — Works well from day one

## Design Philosophy

Every decision we make follows a few key ideas:

- **Developer experience comes first** — Your time is valuable
- **Simple things stay simple** — Basic tasks need simple code
- **Advanced features are available** — But they don't get in your way
- **Each package stands alone** — Use only what you need
