Welcome to the **Rivaas** documentation! Rivaas is a web framework for Go. It includes high-performance routing, request binding and validation, automatic OpenAPI generation, and OpenTelemetry observability.

## What is Rivaas?

Rivaas is a modular Go web framework for building production-ready APIs and web applications. The name comes from **ریواس (Rivās)**, a wild rhubarb plant from the mountains of Iran. This plant grows in harsh conditions at high altitudes.

Like its namesake, Rivaas is:

- **🛡️ Resilient** — Built for production. Includes graceful shutdown, health checks, and panic recovery.
- **⚡ Lightweight** — Minimal overhead (low latency, zero allocations). No loss of features.
- **🔧 Adaptive** — Works locally, in containers, or across distributed systems.
- **📦 Self-sufficient** — Integrated observability. No external dependencies to add.

## Key Features

- **High Performance** — High throughput. Uses radix tree router and Bloom filter optimization. See [Router Performance](/docs/reference/packages/router/performance/) for benchmarks.
- **Production-Ready** — Includes graceful shutdown, health endpoints, panic recovery, and mTLS support.
- **Cloud-Native** — Built with OpenTelemetry. Supports Prometheus, OTLP, and Jaeger.
- **Modular Architecture** — Each package works alone. No need for the full framework.
- **Developer-Friendly** — Sensible defaults. Progressive disclosure. Functional options pattern.
- **Type-Safe** — Request binding and validation with clear error messages.

## Quick Start

**Installation** (requires Go 1.25+):

```bash
go get rivaas.dev/app
```

**Hello World:**

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "os/signal"
    "syscall"

    "rivaas.dev/app"
)

func main() {
    a, err := app.New()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    a.GET("/", func(c *app.Context) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]string{
            "message": "Hello from Rivaas!",
        })
    })

    ctx, cancel := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
    defer cancel()

    if err := a.Start(ctx); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

## Philosophy

Every package in Rivaas follows these design principles:

1. **Developer Experience First** — Sensible defaults, discoverable APIs, clear errors
2. **Functional Options Pattern** — Backward-compatible, self-documenting configuration
3. **Standalone Packages** — Use any package without the full framework
4. **Separation of Concerns** — Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
